Description: CohortDiagnostics is an R utility package for the development and evaluation of phenotype algorithms for
    OMOP CDM compliant data sets. This package provides a standard, end to end, set of analytics for understanding
    patient capture including data generation and result exploration through an R Shiny interface.
    Analytics computed include cohort characteristics, record counts, index event misclassification, captured
    observation windows and basic incidence proportions for age, gender and calendar year.
    Through the identification of errors, CohortDiagnostics enables the comparison of multiple candidate cohort
    definitions across one or more data sources, facilitating reproducible research.
